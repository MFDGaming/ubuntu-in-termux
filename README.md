## What's This?

This is a script that allows you to install Ubuntu in your termux application without a rooted device

## Updates

**• Updated to ubuntu 22.04**

## Important

**• If you have to use ubuntu in termux with a x86/i\*86 architecture or prefer ubuntu 19.10 you can use this branch -> https://github.com/MFDGaming/ubuntu-in-termux/tree/ubuntu19.10**

**• If you get an error message that says "Fatal Kernel too old" you have to uncomment the line that reads "command+=" -k 4.14.81"" (remove the # that is located in front of the line) in the "startubuntu.sh" file**
